# Phyllotactic-Spirals
The goal of this project is to be able to create spiral based patterns that are found in nature. 

Phyllotatic spirals are a natural phenomene that occours in nature. artichokes, cactuses, pineapples, pine cones, and dandilions are all exampales of Phyllotactic Spirals. The patterns of these plants are also a mathematical mystery; to make the patterns shown in these plants the spirals go in altanating directions, and the number of spirals in each direction are factorials (Ex. an pinecone may have 3 spirals going to the left and 5 spirals going to the right 3 and 5 are both factroials and 5 is also the factorial that would be after 3 in asending order)
